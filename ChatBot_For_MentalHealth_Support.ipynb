It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.I would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn't much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you. Perhaps you could look at what makes you feel emotionally safe and trusting with her and focus on that. You could even remind yourself \\\"okay, I'm here with [name of girlfriend] and this is okay when I'm with her.\\\"We all have different levels of defenses in situations in which different people. It's common for people to see these things as black and white (either totally open or very self-protective.

You can change your level of defensiveness with your girlfriend depending upon the location you are in, the mood you are both in, the subject, etc. There are infinite numbers of choices and you can experiment.Another thing that could help is to communicate about communication. If one of you uses a phrase that triggers something from earlier in your life or is really uncomfortable, you could discuss that. If she says certain things that make you feel really comfortable, you could discuss that as well.Hopefully you can learn more about yourselves and each other at the same time.\",\n          \"Crying in therapy is a natural response, a relief to what you are going through.

went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.  i'm not sure if i'm overreacting or not. i just feel like i'm so honest with him about everything, and i expect the same honesty. he is a good

of depression for the past four years, and it hits me harder every time it comes back. this past time, it was extremely debilitating, so i went on wellbutrin. i could feel the effects of the medicine

place of despair. i became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what i needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment. i stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay; a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. however, i still don't feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and i have days where i feel a zombie-like haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything. is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should i go back on the medicine?\",\"i'm a little paranoid. my mind does get the best of me. one night, i put chairs under all of my door knobs because i thought someone might break in. i also think a lot, which is probably

site. we went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, i ended up at her house on a the friday night one week after our first date. we respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. after that, i slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. then one day, she went to her family\\u2019s house on thanksgiving and everything changed. within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. we had finally found each other. we told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. a few days after thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. i was very hurt and didn\\u2019t understand. then another week later, she told me she couldn\\u2019t do it at all anymore. i was crushed!\\r\\n\\r\\na few days later, she tells me how much she\\u2019s missing me and \\u201clet\\u2019s get together for lunch\\u201d or something like that. then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. so for her child\\u2019s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. she had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. she doesn\\u2019t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. i know she needs time, and all i can do is take care of myself. we have agreed to remain friends, and if this

place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. i have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication i seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed. \\r\\n\\r\\ni have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and i have never heard these comments from anyone else before. i have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether i truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings\\u002fpeople, or positive, but in the end, i am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat can i do?\",\"my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous \\\"you're doing it wrong\\u2014do it this way\\\" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?\",\"i have not been able to really sleep. i stay up all times of the night not even knowing why. every day, i feel like i have anger inside of me. i have a little family, but i can't open up to them like i want to. i have a son, and i feel that i take my anger out on him by screaming at him.\",\"my husband and i have been together for seven years now. i will be honest: i have a problem lying to him about stupid stuff. i recently stupidly lied to my husband about an accident because i was afraid to tell him what happened. ever since then, he gives me the cold shoulder. he gets so mad and ignores me for days. he's really verbally and emotionally abusive. he tells me all the bad things about me and calls me awful names. should we call it quits? i'm tired of crying, but we have a toddler

consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. but we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until i got pregnant with our second child.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe baby was

gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). he confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. he said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she

being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. he feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, i would still accuse him. he's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because i'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\ni'm of course hurt and in shock. i feel like i have to make a decision on whether i want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. both of these decisions are really

for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i

called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life

were friends for a long time. in 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since i lived out of state. i planned to move in with him in 2014 after i finished school and he found a job. however, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. we decided later to make it work. shortly after, i found out that i was pregnant. i wanted to tell him during his next visit. however, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. after i gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts.    soon after, i experienced a miscarriage. i texted him about what had happened, and he didn\\u2019t seem to care. i was extremely hurt by this. i still decided to move back as i had originally planned. he helped me with the move and replaced the money i had lent him. during this time, i asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because i needed to know. although he says he did, i hardly ever see him. he never got a job, which was in the original plan.    after that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. once we got back together, i cut all ties with the former relationship i had been in. i thought he had too. but i found out that he did not attempt to do as i did and was still talking with another woman. in fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. when i confronted him about this, he wasn\\u2019t apologetic. he said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. he even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car. i don\\u2019t know what to do.\",\"i was in a relationship with a woman for four years. we both made mistakes, but i do love her.    she has moved in with another lady. i think she is just cheating on me to make me miss her. how can i find out for sure?\",\"i've been with my boyfriend over 3 years. he cheated on me and the woman is now pregnant. he is physically and mentally abusive towards me. i have attempted to talk with him in order to resolve our issues; however, he never wants to talk and often blames me for everything. i\\u2019m always there when he needs my help. he tells me although i help him doesn\\u2019t mean that i am a good person. he always discredits me as a woman and it\\u2019s hurtful. i spend most day crying and feeling lonely. i am unhappy and unsure of what i need to do.\",\"my kid\\u2019s dad and i broke up two years ago. he still wants me back, and i just started to fall for him again. but our kids are with child protective services: that\\u2019s why we broke up. he started to talk to other women, and he put his hands on me.\",\"i'm a teenager, and throughout my entire life, i've never really had good parents, or parents at all for that matter. i'm not exaggerating. i was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when i was in middle school. his mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom\\u2019s house, and i was so awe-stricken with my dad that i got to stay with him for a long time. meanwhile, i did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. my mom went to prison for that and lost her caf\\u00e9. we live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and i was bullied because of who my parents were. my dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison.\\n   my mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person\\u2019s house. my parents did not get along at this point. we were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. he got out of the car, went to the driver\\u2019s side, and punched my mom in the face. i got out and told him not to hit my mom. at that point, i was really scared and mad that he did that, so i ran towards him to stop him. he literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. i couldn't even walk. my mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. i hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. he was so badly strung out on drugs. he went to prison again and seems to be doing well. i met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle. i think a lot of it is that i can't bring myself to forgive him. my mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, i moved in with my dad\\u2019s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because i trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. i also stay at my boyfriend\\u2019s a lot. now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life. she\\u2019s trying to make me move back home out of susan's house, and i don't want to. i don't like it there. they condone drug abuse and many other things, and i'm just not comfortable. she's even threatened to call the police and say i'm a runaway because she has custody of me. my boyfriend has always had this picture-perfect life, and his family are strict christians. one time, his mom even went as far as to say that if he and i break up, if we were having sex, i would say that he raped me. i've got so many problems i don't even know what to do.\",\"i have an emotionally abusive relationship. we have been together for a year and a half. he got out of prison exactly a year ago and a half ago, and we have a infant. i love my boyfriend, and i don't want to leave without fighting for this first. he's an emotionally disconnected person. we never say \\u201ci love you\\u201d to each other. every fight is worse than the last one, and i don't know what to do. he doesn't let me speak because he's louder than me, and that makes me feel frustrated. i have another problem: english is my second language. i pay half of the bills, and every time i want to speak to him, he kicks me out of the house. he apologizes sometimes. i feel like i'm the only one fighting for this. he agreed to have counseling.\",\"my friend\\u2019s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. he has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. he has held her a prisoner in her home. he has choked her, hit her, etc. she has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. she and i went to a wedding out of town in september of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. now he is saying that i have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.\",\"an organization admitted to implanting thoughts in my head with technologies. the study was to implant a fantasy other people are having, but to me, it's a nightmare. i lost my kids, my job, and all

sick. he came out to see if i was okay, and i said no. i said i wanted to go home, and he told me to come lay down. as i laid down on the bed, he started touching me. a friend called me, then i able to leave.\",\"my boyfriend and i have a terrible sex life after three years of dating, and i don't know what to do. i have this lingering fear of pain during sex after having two partners previously who weren't careful. how can i stop projecting this onto my current boyfriend?\",\"my dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that i can't function properly. letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but i\\u2019m terrified to get better because i don't even know who i am without the trauma. i've never gotten to be myself. i don't even know who i am.\",\"i'm a young adult woman, and i have trouble finding my true identity being at home. this all started when i had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. my boyfriend and i were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. at the time, i was pretty religious, but i let this happen. i don't know why. i felt kind of guilty but mostly because i know my parents wouldn't like it. my parents are very religious\\u2014they're christians. we did things every time he'd come over to my house. we didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\\n   one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.\",\"i was having a sexual relationship with a coworker. he decided he was going to get a hotel room for the weekend. before i got

room he decided to get. he stayed at the hotel, and i left. i don't think it's right that he want me to reimburse him $25.00 for a hotel room he wanted to get in the first place. he is out of town right now and texted me yesterday telling me i am a liar and that i should never said i was going to have $25.00 when i knew i wasn't. i told him i had to pay rent and my rent was late. he texted me

regularly despite the fact that he is living back with his ex-girlfriend and kids. he is \\\"co-existing\\\" for the kids and fighting all the time with his ex-girlfriend. his daughters don\\u2019t want their dad with me because my two boys (grown adults and on their own now) had bad reputations and issues with drugs. his daughters say it is embarrassing for him to be with me. he and i had an absolutely amazing relationship and connect on so many levels. he is getting a lot of pressure from his family and his longtime friends to \\\"do the right thing\\\" and stay with his ex-girlfriend for the kids. he says he wants me to wait. we were going get married last year. he bought me a $1000 dress, we had invitations made, and everything set up, but then his girls told him they'd never

me from the relationship. this anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. while a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it\\u2019s an emotional nightmare i can\\u2019t get to the bottom of. i\\u2019ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time i made contact with my crush. what could be the reason behind this? is it massive nerve problems? is it a fear of a bad relationship?\\n   while i\\u2019m not quite ready to be in one anyway, i want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which i can be in one. i don\\u2019t take medications and have no desire to, i have read forums, and i\\u2019ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.\",\"my fianc\\u00e9e suffers from severe anxiety and depression. she has had it most of her life. her anxiety in public places is the worst. it gets to points where she can't breathe or move. sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. she curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. she won't eat or drink in public. if she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. she get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that i can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. she always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. she will refuse to go to a store unless i am with her to talk to the cashier for her. she is so scared that i can't even get her to drive. she doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.\\n   some people have recommended medication, but i believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. i don't want my fianc\\u00e9e pumped with drugs. i believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. when we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. she took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. she slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. i am worried and want to help her without medication.\",\"i have no friends, no hobbies, and no interest in anything. i get annoyed with everything and everyone. i am always tired, i can sleep 8 hrs or 12 hrs and im still tired. i don't know

i've been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. he is honestly the only person i trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. i cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. my insurance has a $5000 deductible, so i\\u2019m screwed. i've had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. i have no one. my family doesn't care about me; they kicked me out when i turned 18 a few years ago. i had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. my ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time i see or hear him, i break down into tears. i found out that i will never be promoted now because of my depression.\",\"my depression has been reoccurring for a long time. it all started when i was being bullied in high school. in ninth grade, my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. after that, i was fine for a couple of years. i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. i believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. obviously, that wasn't the right choice. i regret ever doing that, seeing as even though i'm not self-harming anymore, i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed. i have a big problem with handling problems in life. whenever a problem arises, i get stressed and i feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. i get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldn't be sad all the time, and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.\",\"my mother is combative with me when i say i don't want to talk with her about my depression.    she hasn't been supportive of me in the past and she isn't someone that i feel

help?\",\"i have been with my husband for almost 7 years. we got engaged a little after 5 years of being together. i had always been clear that i wanted to get married and i sadly would drop hints about how i wanted him to propose.  when he did propose it was during a random vacation that i had planned. i was happy but i couldn't help feeling disappointed too. i had told him numerous times before that i wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. i know it sounds dumb to be upset but i couldn't help how i was feeling. we are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what i wanted and it wasn't due to lack of funds. i know this is all material and the marriage is the most important thing but i cant help but get jealous and envious every time i see someone get a proposal or wedding that i had wanted. i cant help my anger because i know we only get one proposal and one wedding. what i wanted will never happen. i have been working on my feelings for the past year and half to get over it. i try to focus on our marriage but every time i see someone have the best proposals and weddings i get upset. i know it is selfish and i know its petty but i just can't control it. it's ruining our relationship because i constantly think about it. plus, i get mad at him for small things because i am trying to hide the fact that i am so disappointed.  why can't i move on?\",\"my husband and i would've been married for five years come june 2016. our infant daughter just had her birthday. shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. he has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. he decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. the children do not have a good relationship with him now. he has another child from a woman he was dating. he decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.    it seems to me that there is a pattern. he easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. i've tried to research online, but i'm not getting any answers. he also has an unhealthy dependency on alcohol and does not believe in mental health disorders such as depression and bi-polar disorder. he also does not believe in therapy or seeking help from professionals. is there a detachment disorder or some form of mental block he could have? where do you recommend researching this?\",\"if i tell him i don't like certain things, he does when it pertains to me. he tells me it's not like that. he never has anything to say

sister\\u2019s house everything changed. that's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. i thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. then she told me to come to her in missouri. so that's what i did. i quit my job i dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. once i got there everything was fine again. \\u00a0she apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. then she went back to saying she didn\\u2019t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. the only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant.

sometimes i think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? i truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. he's a great guy! i just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. he's starting to put less effort in talking to me. at this point i'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. i tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. advice on what to do?\",\"my girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. they were very close. she took care of her till she died. things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. intimacy fell off. i asked what's up. she says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. she used to be very open and expressive. now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. when we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. now i'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. she says otherwise, but i don't know. it just feels like something is really off.\",\"we kissed and he grabbed my boobs and we exchanged some texts and a few calls. it went on for about 8 months. just when we were all together and our spouses were out of the room. once i met him for lunch to tell him that we needed to stop. we ended up kissing after lunch and then i sent him a few more texts that day telling him i was serious and that was the end of it. his wife (my good friend) saw us kiss once and told my husband. i told him a couple of things then and we got over it. a year later she told him a couple of other things. same story. it's been about 3 years since. they are now divorced and my husband and i have been happy. a few weeks ago the wife called me and said that her now ex told her more stuff we did. i decided to just tell my husband everything. we are trying to work things out. but he is having a really hard time believing that he knows all of it. how can i help him believe me?\",\"i know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. once he believes i am being negative i can't seem to find a better way of communicating. in fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating.    what advice might you offer?\",\"my boyfriend says i'm nuts. i need to get help because i get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. whenever i try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what i'm doing wrong. i know that accusing him does not help. when his whole demeanor shifts towards me, i can't help but think that something is wrong. am i wrong for feeling this way? i try to talk with him to make it better. i let him know when i am feeling down. but i am not confident in these things.  two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. he texted her back with \\\"sorry, i've been working. i just read your message.\\\" the girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. he texted her back with \\\"don't text me anymore.\\\" i don't feel like i am way out of the line. but i can't talk with him if all

from four years ago, and my current friend. it\\u2019s like i can't get past it, and i need some kind of closure. i keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. nothing was ever wrong with it. now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least i feel it when we're physically in the same place.\\n   two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. i'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. despite the age difference, i know we're a really good match. we've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. i tell him everything. also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. he\\u2019s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. that summer, i told him i didn't want anything serious and broke it off. only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. his girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. i'm sure she may be different around him, but i worry about him committing to her in the long run. they're supposed to move in together soon. but still, i feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and i feel like he does too.    i don't know what to do. i need some closure or i'm not going to be able to move on from this. i don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. i\\u2019m so happy with my current boyfriend, and i know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. he\\u2019s such a good person. i also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but i can't get it out of my head. i'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but i can't sleep because my mind is racing. i've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.\\n   i want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but i don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. if he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. if my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. on one hand, i want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but i would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. where would i go from there? on the other hand, i feel like i can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. sometimes i wish i could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but i don't want to.\\n   please help me, because i really have no idea what to do.\",\"i'm an early 20 something year-old virgin, and my boyfriend is in his early 20s with kids. he's cheated on me twice: once in the beginning and then four months ago. he wasn't use to dating a virgin and broke up with me three times because he wasn't sure. we both work at the same job (where we met) and it\\u2019s with the girl that works with us. i've been trying to get over it, but now my confidence and self-esteem are low, and sometimes i feel like he\\u2019ll do it again or that he's not ready to be with me. i think about it all over again when i see her. he says he's in love with me, and with the last time he cheated, it didn't feel right, and that's when he knew he had to stop because his feelings were for me. he's contacted her and told her he will not communicate with her because he's in a relationship with me.\\n   how do i gain confidence? should i let him go? if i let

convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but i don't really believe him.    lately, tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. he's been asking me to help him with sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. but he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. he seems really torn up about it, and i want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves.    he knows that i still crush on him. he doesn't rub it in my face. he's a good guy, but i want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. how do i do that when the time comes? how do i support him and show him that i'm here without wanting to hook up? how do i make him feel better? he is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which i think is ridiculous.\",\"i am currently

two people who will always be in my life. i had a daughter with my ex-boyfriend. i am now married, and my husband\\u2019s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. they also have a daughter together. my issue is that there is always drama. i am pregnant, and i told my ex-boyfriend that i don't want any drama or arguments. i want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. however, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. i told him that he needed to ask my husband because i can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. that led to an argument. i told him all my concern is when i pick up my daughter. my stepdaughter\\u2019s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. i especially told him i didn't want to be involved. somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. he threatened me and got ugly because i wouldn\\u2019t discuss my stepdaughter\\u2019s matters with him.\\n   the point is there is so much drama. i try my best to get along with everyone. i don't understand where i went wrong (besides replying back to his question). i feel like i'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone\\u2019s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. i had a party planned for my daughter\\u2019s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn\\u2019t let me have her. in my eyes, it\\u2019s the child that is hurting. i was throwing a party for her birthday, and because of the problem with stupid pick-up details about my stepdaughter, which i have no control over, he took it out on our daughter.\",\"my dad doesn't like the fact that i'm a boy. he yells at me daily because of it and he tells me i'm extreme and over dramatic.\\n   i get so depressed because of my dad's yelling. he keeps asking me why i can't just be happy the way i am and yells at me on a daily basis. is this considered emotional abuse?\",\"we rent from from my boyfriend's parents. his father drops by unannounced and stays for long periods of time. he lets himself into our home when we aren't there on a daily basis and takes our dogs to his house. he picks up our mail. he has no boundaries.    he's an opinionated, rude pushy person. he expects to spend every weekend around us, gives unsolicited advice on child rearing and does not respect our privacy at all. he barges in with no warning. he has a key and lets himself into our house without asking permission. i need help. how do i address this?\",\"ever since my mother passed away my family has treated me like a stranger. now i'm concerned that my father will need to go into a nursing home. if that happens i think i'm going to be on my own to handle it.    what should i do? i'm going to need my family's help and support.\",\"for the past week or so me and my boyfriend have been fighting. he has been making a lot of bad choices and he is currently hospitalized. i'm barely eating or sleeping because i'm constantly worried about him. everyone else in my life says that i

he's sick in the head. now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. i ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my mom's face. i feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. we tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. they do nothing to try and help.\",\"my wife and i are newly married, about 2 months. we've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. she's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but i think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy\\u002fromance centered around my hectic schedule. our sex life has suffered as a result. tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm i've ever encountered. i was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. she responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. i don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. i think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. please help.\",\"she's my stepmom. i'm pretty sure she's illegally buying the drugs and hiding them from my dad.\",\"my boyfriend and i recently broke up. one week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. he completely deleted me out of his life. he does have an opiate addiction. he claimed he was sober, but since we've split, i've heard many lies from him. could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?\",\"what can i do to stop grieving my mother\\u2019s death? when i am awake i just cry every day. i don't have anyone to talk to. i need help; i am still cry over her. will i ever stop crying? it\\u2019s been 3 years.\",\"my wife is trying to leave. she agreed to come back and give me a little time. even said she hopes i can do it. we buried our first born in jan 13 years ago. she never got past it. so every year around this time, she gets emotional and says she doesn't think she loves me, but then we go back to normal. this time, another guy came in and showed her attention. i'll forgive the cheating if she'll come home.\",\"the past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like i'm high off nostalgia. but in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the

closed everyone out. i\\u2019ve even told my husband that i wanted a divorce since that\\u2019s what i thought he wanted to hear. however, it devastated me when i learned he's seeing someone else.\\n i\\u2019ve since told him that i wanted to work things out but he\\u2019s not sure i actually mean it. he thinks the only reason i want him back is because i\\u2019m jealous. how do i show him

exaggerating. i was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when i was in middle school. his mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom\\u2019s house, and i was so awe-stricken with my dad that i got to stay with him for a long time. meanwhile, i did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs. my mom went to prison for that and lost her caf\\u00e9. we live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and i was bullied because of who my parents were. my dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison.\\n   my mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person\\u2019s house. my parents did not get along at this point. we were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out. he got out of the car, went to the driver\\u2019s side, and punched my mom in the face. i got out and told him not to hit my mom. at that point, i was really scared and mad that he did that, so i ran towards him to stop him. he literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road. i couldn't even walk. my mom tried to help me, but he started choking her. i hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance. he was so badly strung out on drugs. he went to prison again and seems to be doing well. i met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle. i think a lot of it is that i can't bring myself to forgive him. my mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, i moved in with my dad\\u2019s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because i trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents. i also stay at my boyfriend\\u2019s a lot. now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life. she\\u2019s trying to make me move back home out of susan's house, and i don't want to. i don't like it there. they condone drug abuse and many other things, and i'm just not comfortable. she's even threatened to call the police and say i'm a runaway because she has custody of me. my boyfriend has always had this picture-perfect life, and his family are strict christians. one time, his mom even went as far as to say that if he and i break up, if we were having sex, i would say that he raped me. i've got so many problems i don't even know what to do.\",\"i'm a teenager, and while i\\u2019ve never been to any kind of therapist, i

the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous \\\"you're doing it wrong\\u2014do it this way\\\" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?\",\"my boyfriend and i have not had sex in a couple of weeks. he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. i have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. i'm scared to touch him and get close to him because i'm afraid that i will hurt him.\",\"my boyfriend and i recently broke up. one week, we were fine, and the next, he told me he needed space. he completely deleted me out of his life. he does have an opiate addiction. he claimed he was sober, but since we've split, i've heard many lies from him. could he be using again, and does this addiction affect the mind?\",\"my boyfriend called me a particular profanity and i broke up with him. this is the third time he's called me this and i'm just completely done with giving him chances. he knows how much it bothers me. i just want to know if i'm over reacting.\",\"my boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. he says he loves me  but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual distraction. he says he should have had more sex with different people. i don't know how to handle this.\",\"my boyfriend can't get over my promiscuous past. he says he loves me but says the thought of my past is disgusting and a sexual

more. every time she leaves, he gets into these funks like when his mom died. when she\\u2019s here, she\\u2019s disrespectful, and his answer is \\u201cwell, i don\\u2019t know what to tell you.\\u201d she swears and talks back, and he laughs. he and her mom have been apart for three years, and he blames her behavior on that and her being so young. we never have adult time when

i decided to meet her. that made the situation worse because they were even closer than what i thought. they acted like a couple rather than friends with each other. there was no physical interaction,

childhood issues. he has kids from his previous ex-wife and is unable to see them.\",\"my boyfriend lost his dad to suicide. he says that because his dad died, so did his heart. he says that he can't be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again. why is he doing this when we were very happy together? he says that i have done nothing wrong but he just can't be with me.\",\"my boyfriend moved in with me a few months ago. i love him, but his dog is wrecking my house. every day we get home, there is a huge mess on the floor, and several things will be ripped up (including the couch). he's slowly eating all of the doors, and there will be food and poop everywhere. even though i come home during all of my breaks to take him out, he still poops and pees in the house every chance. i can't financially afford to have the dog wrecking my house. i've tried talking to my boyfriend about the dog to try and come up with a solution, but it never ends well. the dog is the only thing we fight about because i want him out of the house and my boyfriend doesn't want to see him go. it\\u2019s not the dog fault though; i understand that. the dog is only a year old, and he isn't a bad dog. he's just too big of a dog for where he is; he should be a farm dog instead of a town dog. i don't hate the dog, but i just can't afford to continue having my house torn to pieces.\",\"my boyfriend of eight years and father of our two children is a truck driver. he is never home and only contributes to our family financially. there is no other support given. he comes

and loves me, and i believe it. it has been one of the best relationships i have been in for a short period of time, but he has lied to me so much. he\\u2019ll tell me that he'll stop lying, and while he\\u2019s saying that, he's hiding something or lying about something. first, it was about a girl. he hid text messages and claimed she was a friend and it was a friendly conversation when it was a girl he once found interest in. next was his ex-girlfriend. he put a fake contact name, and it was just friendly, but he lied to my face. all the time, he claims he never cheated and still expresses his love the same way and that he wants to change and do better.\",\"my boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. we've since gotten back together and

know if this would contribute to this. how should i approach this?\",\"my depression has been reoccurring for a long time. it all started when i was being bullied in high school. in ninth grade, my principal told me i needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. i needed professional help for my stress because i was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. after that, i was fine for a couple of years. i entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. i believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. i began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. obviously, that wasn't the right choice. i regret ever doing that, seeing as even though i'm not self-harming anymore, i always look back at that time whenever i feel very stressed. i have a big problem with handling problems in life. whenever a problem arises, i get stressed and i feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. i get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. i have a hard time coping with stress because i know that if i could handle it easily then i wouldn't be sad all the time, and i would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.\",\"my doctor seems to think i am in danger of having one. i neglected to ask how this was different than an

            "   one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrong—do it this way\" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?       1.00      1.00      1.00         1\n",

            "   one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "one day, my parents found out i did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. as soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. they were both aggravated. they told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. they said he wanted me for sex and he's not a christian. i took their advice and broke up with him. once we broke up for about a month, i decided to get back together with him a little after school started. my parents found out eventually, and i decided to not listen this time. i would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and god totally forbids him. i would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually i would just never listen to my parents. they're always yelling at me about how i shouldn't date this boy. i felt too old to listen to them. now i'm kind of just stuck. is the real me religious? have i been brainwashed by him? i don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think i'm deceiving because of it. they threatened me that if i'm still with him, i can't do track and they won't support me. they've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. they say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. i'm actually very happy with him. they also say i'm living a separate life at home than i am at school. they say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "my boyfriend and i have been together for five years now. throughout the entire first day that we met, he and i had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. that same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed. the next two days were a repetition of the first day. on the third night, my mother finally caught us, and i was kicked out of my house. i left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. it was very hard for us. his stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had. i quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. there were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a walmart parking lot. our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. after that, it was a downward spiral. we were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. we kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrong—do it this way\" argument. after six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started. one afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. i was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. he told me to let him leave or he would hit me. he had once promised he would never touch me, so i challenged him to do it. he slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me. i haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now. i don't live with him, i don't depend on him, and we don't have children. we both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly. he always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change. now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how i don't ever make the effort to try to be okay. i've read enough about domestic violence to know that it's not my fault that he loses control, so that's not even an issue for me. i know he has to change that on his own. i just want to know if there's people who have gone through this and had the tables turned? is there hope for a better future together?       1.00      1.00      1.00         1\n",

            "Chatbot: Your fear is somewhat reasonable.  No one wants to be raped and I imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel like.Do you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would like?If this is the case, then try understanding the reason behind your fear.Is it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped?  One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe.  The more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking, isolated physical surroundings, and being in isolated locations with someone with whom you're not very familiar, probably your fear will decrease.The other general direction to understand is if in your family history, people have been violated severely, either emotionally, mentally, or physically.In families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves, often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others, plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generation.Its possible then, that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own suffering.The good news is that individual therapy, with a credentialed and licensed therapist, is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden.\n",
            "User: She cried because she lost all trust in me. Now I feel disgusting and like my heart just got stabbed, what do I do?\n",
            "Chatbot: You felt bad when you lied, so you told the truth.  I imagine your mom was really shocked and upset - both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person.  It's possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child, from whom she always assumed honesty, was capable of being dishonest.  That's not awesome, but it's not the end of the world.  You made a mistake - you'll make more of those in your life, just try not to make the same ones over and over again.It sounds like you and your mom are close so I can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you.  Since you are a fundamentally honest person, the way back to being trusted is going to be simple, but may take a little time.  The \"recipe\" is easy - say what you are doing/going to do; do only that unless change is necessary, in which case you inform others involved, and repeat.  And cut yourself some slack.  Your mom will recover and so will you.  It's an important and painful lesson about integrity, but once learned it will serve you well.\n",
            "User: Okay bye\n",
            "Chatbot: Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. I truly wish I could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction, but unfortunately I can't do that. Their acceptance of you is a journey, just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way, but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately, there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So, here are a few things I would suggest:Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won't take the place of your family's acceptance, and I won't even pretend that it would, but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at, but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this, they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile, so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you, try to talk to them, but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself, and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you're describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may, or they may not. And if they don't, you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that. If you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling, chatting with counselor may be a great idea. I am bias probably, but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea. :) Hope this helps. Be well. Be you. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC\n",
